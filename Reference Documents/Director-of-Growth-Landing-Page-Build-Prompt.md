# Director of Growth Landing Page — Build Prompt

## Project Overview

Build a single-page interactive landing page for Saltbox's Director of Growth role. This is not a typical job posting — it's a candidate assessment experience that embodies Saltbox's philosophy of hiring for capability over credentials.

The page should:
- Introduce Saltbox and the role
- Articulate the "we hire differently" philosophy
- Explain the assessment candidates will complete
- Provide a functional submission form
- Demonstrate through its own quality that Saltbox practices what it preaches

**Target hosting**: Render (static site)
**Format**: Single-page React application or self-contained HTML

## Complete Copy

### Section 1: Hero

**Headline:**
We're hiring a Director of Growth. *Show us what you can build.*

**Subhead:**
We don't count years on your resume. We don't care which logos you've collected. We care what you can produce today — with the full power of modern tools at your fingertips.

**CTA Button:**
See the role →

---

### Section 2: About Saltbox

**Section Header:**
This is Saltbox

**Body:**
We're building the infrastructure that helps product-based businesses scale — without the friction, overhead, or long-term commitments that usually come with growth.

We combine flexible warehouse space with modern offices, logistics support, and a community of entrepreneurs, all under one roof. Our members are ecommerce founders building brands in fashion, beauty, home goods, food, and beyond. They come to us when they've outgrown their garage but aren't ready for a traditional warehouse lease or 3PL.

We're not just a space. We're a partner — from first sale to full scale.

---

### Section 3: The Role

**Section Header:**
What you'll own

**Body:**
The Director of Growth owns Saltbox's entire growth engine: paid acquisition across Google and Meta, AI-powered outbound and GTM, conversion optimization, lifecycle marketing, and experimentation.

This isn't a traditional performance marketing role. Yes, you'll manage CAC and optimize funnels. But we're looking for something more — a growth leader who operates at a fundamentally different speed because of how they leverage AI.

The best growth marketers today aren't just strategists. They're builders. They use AI to produce 10x the creative variations, construct intelligent outbound systems, and move from insight to execution in hours instead of weeks.

If that's how you work, keep reading.

### Section 4: How We Hire

**Section Header:**
We hire *differently*

**Body:**
Most companies hire based on pedigree. Years of experience. Brand-name employers. Degrees from the right schools.

We don't.

We believe the growth marketing landscape has fundamentally shifted. The candidates who will win aren't necessarily the ones with the longest resumes — they're the ones who've learned to operate with AI as a true force multiplier.

So we designed a hiring process that lets you prove it.

No recruiter screens optimizing for keywords. No panel interviews testing how well you perform under interrogation. Instead, we give you a real challenge, full access to any tools you want, and space to show us what you can do.

**Callout Block:**
We're remote-first and globally open. Whether you're in Atlanta or Accra, if you can work Eastern Time hours and deliver the work, your location and background don't limit you here.

---

### Section 5: The Assessment

**Section Header:**
The challenge

**Intro:**
We're asking you to do something close to what you'd do in your first weeks on the job: understand our business, spot an opportunity, and show us how you'd create impact.

**Part 1: Reverse-engineer our growth engine**
Using publicly available information, map out how Saltbox positions itself, how we acquire customers, and identify one specific gap or inefficiency in our current approach.

**Part 2: Propose an AI-powered initiative**
Based on your analysis, propose one specific AI-enabled initiative you'd launch in your first 30 days. Tell us what it is, how you'd build it, and what success looks like.

**Part 3: Present it**
Package your thinking in whatever format best demonstrates your strategic clarity and your feel for our brand. A deck, a Notion doc, a Loom, a designed PDF — your call.

**Part 4: Show your work**
Include a brief "How I Built This" appendix: what tools you used, how you spent your time, what you'd do with more of it.

**Callout Block — Time:**
We don't expect you to spend more than an hour. But we're not enforcing a stopwatch — if you want to go deeper because you're excited about the work, we welcome that. What we're evaluating is the quality of your thinking and the sophistication of your process, not whether you hit an arbitrary time limit.

**Callout Block — AI:**
Use AI. Seriously. This is not a test of what you can produce without help — it's a test of what you can produce with the best tools available. We're hiring for an AI-native operator, and we want to see how you actually work.

### Section 6: What We're Looking For

**Section Header:**
What *great* looks like

**Dimension Cards:**

1. **Depth of insight** — You saw something non-obvious about our business, not just what we do but where the gaps are.

2. **Strategic clarity** — Your recommendation is specific and actionable. We could brief it to a team tomorrow.

3. **AI fluency** — Your proposed initiative and your process reflect genuine understanding of what's possible with modern tools.

4. **Brand resonance** — Your presentation feels like it could come from Saltbox. You absorbed our voice.

5. **Execution quality** — The work is polished enough that we'd consider actually using it.

---

### Section 7: Compensation & Benefits

**Section Header:**
What we offer

**Body:**
$120,000–$180,000 base salary depending on experience, plus performance-based bonus.

Medical insurance fully covered, 401(k), paid parental leave, generous PTO, dedicated learning budget, and access to Saltbox locations nationwide.

Remote-first. Eastern Time working hours required.

---

### Section 8: Submit

**Section Header:**
Ready? *Show us.*

**Body:**
Upload your work below. We accept any format — PDF, deck, Notion export, Loom link, whatever works for you. Include your "How I Built This" summary either in your submission or in the notes field.

**Form Fields:**
- Name (text input, required)
- Email (email input, required)
- Upload file (file input, accepts any type, required)
- Notes / anything else you want us to know (textarea, optional)

**Button:**
Submit your work

---

### Section 9: What Happens Next

**Body:**
We review every submission within 24 hours. If we love what you've done, we'll reach out promptly to schedule an interview — and we'll complete our entire interview process within a week.

No months of waiting. No endless rounds. We move fast, and we respect your time.
